            "So whats with the whole magician thing?"
        </h3>
        <pre>
            The whole magician vibe i go for comes from two things. firstly, i've always loved the spellcaster class in games or ttrpgs.
            ive always loved playing wizards or mages in those big RPGs you sink your teeth into, and i always, ALWAYS play warlock in D&D.
            and so i think wizards are cool and if i could have one wish in life, it would be for me to become one fully fledged.

            Secondly, it comes from the first card in the tarot major arcana. The Magician.
            The magician symbolizes new beginning, and manifestation of work you put out, to come back to you as what you want/need.
            its always been a belief of mine that you "reap what you sow". what you put out there will eventually come back to you. whether you want it to or not

            that explains my fascination and whole themeing of my online persona, i hope so at least.

        <h3>So whats with the skeletons?</h3>
        <pre>
            they're cool, deal with it. im not a satanist or devil worshipper, theyre just really cool. end of story

        <h3>General frustration with the university system</h3>
        <pre>
            look, i understand that not everyone can pick up or understand programming logic and ideas as smoothly as someone who is clearly an absolute GENUIS like myself <del>definetly not because i watched bro-code's entire web tutorial</del>
            but MAN does it suck when you're stuck in a lecture, and you cant get to any of the cool or fun stuff immediately because he needs to explain everything in such minute detail.
            but man thats absolute <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=b2ebe082409475c6JmltdHM9MTcyMjI5NzYwMCZpZ3VpZD0yNGM0MTY5Ni1hMmVmLTZiY2EtMjI2Yy0wMjVhYTMxMjZhMmQmaW5zaWQ9NTIzMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=24c41696-a2ef-6bca-226c-025aa3126a2d&psq=aids+foundation&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWlkcy5vcmcuemEv&ntb=1">aids</a>
            overall, im happy i get to help some people when they ask, and im happy that my lecturer cares enough to actually go through everything, i just wish i could skip ahead to the projects and the fun, programming stuff
