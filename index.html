i do a lot of stuff, and instead of making a huge wall of text explaining allat<br>
this website exists to show off what i do, both for fun and for school/work :D
            </pre>
            <pre>
I'm a lot of things, mainly a loser. but i have some cool things about me too!!
            </pre>
           <pre>
            <ul>
                <li>    I'm a developer - primarily for discord bots, wherein i write <del>shitty</del> amazing code :)</li>
                <li>    I also am huge into music. a musician of 12 years and with spotify perpetually in my ears</li>
            </ul>
In here you will find all the things i love to share and babble about, including my code, music taste, and everything inbetween.
This website itself is also a passion project, I love the feel of the retro internet, and im doing my best to bring that emotion back.
Take a look around, and thanks for stopping by :)
